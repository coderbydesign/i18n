# Springboard i18n

This repo will serve as a collection of translations in various locales. Other projects should submodule
this repository to take advantage of fresh translations.

Eventually we hope to build this out as an easy way to manage and output .json files for multiple frameforks. For examples:

Laravel likes
```json
"We can accomodate up to :num_people people per station, and up to :num_stations stations max": "We can accomodate up to :num_people people per station, and up to :num_stations stations max",
```

Vuei18n likes
```json
"We can accomodate up to {0} people per station, and up to {1} stations max": "We can accomodate up to {0} people per station, and up to {1} stations max",
```
